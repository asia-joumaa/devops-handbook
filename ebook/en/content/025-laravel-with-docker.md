## Containers 1: Deploy a Laravel App into a Docker Container

### Get Started

Whenever you search on google you find tutorials on how to deploy Laravel App with docker-compose not just docker container. 
#### But what is the difference? 
1. Docker run versus docker-compose is that docker run is entirely command line based, while docker-compose reads configuration data from a YAML file. 
2. Docker run can only start one container at a time, while docker-compose will configure and run multiple.

When you are working with Laravel, you need multiple services to be configured while starting Laravel project, like: MySQL database, redis, mailhog and other services. All these can be configured together using docker-compose and become connected to each other. 
But sometimes we just need to configure one container for our laravel project without reconfiguring all other services.
